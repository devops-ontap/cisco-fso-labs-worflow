There are two tracks to this lab:
=================================
The primary track is the API Enablement Track:
==============================================
This track gets Developers, Devops, Netops, AIOPS, and Network Admins up and running with the FSO APIs.

The Secondary track is the Deployment of the Lab Infrastructure Track:
=======================================================================
This track is for students/companies that currently do not have an in house Cisco FSO Lab
This track enables an individual or company to deploy the underlying infrastructure to their Cloud Provider(AWS) - so they can
easily integrate the FSO products with their own infrastructure components


API Enablement Track
=======================
This lab will enable you to get and running developing code in a Devops CI framework to the Cisco
FSO APIs

This is a skills development lab that engages the lab participant(student) in the hands on work of writing/editing/developing
automation code in small chunks called "tasks".

There are very few power point slides and the slides provided are to provide an outline and high level concept definitions only.

Students are encouraged to perform trial and error code dev so that they can learn from trial and error and mistakes and become
comfortable with the Agile Rapid Iteration Development workflow.

So while teaching the technology this lab also teaches a Devops workflow.
This lab uses new technology as a wedge to make Knowledge Workers work differently ~ faster, more efficiently, more cost affective while enabling
them to perform rapid development in a CICD workflow.

The Primary target Audience for this lab is:
============================================
DEVOPS 
NETOPS
AIOPS

The Secondary target audience for this lab is:
============================================
Network Admins who currently use some form of configuration management such as Ansible, Terraform and 
would like to transition into a DEVOPS or NETOPS using CICD, Automation Tasks, and Pipelines.

Tertiary Audience:
Business Audience who is interested in understanding at a high level "capabilities" in regards to using the FSO stack APIs to 
harvest the data for AIOPS or integrate to their own custom solutions or for bulk automation tasks such as bulk install, config
lifecyle of the products themselves.
