15 min Power Point Intro
This time is used to outline the lab curriculum, a high level explanation of the lab environment architecture and objectives 

15 min - Instructor will demonstrate the lab workflow(DEVOPS RAPID SDLC with rapid iteration) -how all lab participants logon to fly and paste and info into chat
All students should  be authenticated to fly, have cloned git repo, checked out their branch and logged on to both fly and git and have an IDE installed(only Intellij Jet Brains will be used on lab)
Students will verify they are able to login to Thousand Eyes, Intersight, and AppDyanmics GUI.
Login creds for GUIs will be provided in chat channel day of lab.

15 min - Review of why building our code in OCI ephemeral build containers is critical to automation and pipelining success
15 min - Instructor will spend 5 min explaining how programatic authentication is achieved to each of the apps.
15 min - Students will repeat the steps the instructor performed by running the respective lab task provided by instructor

At the end of this module, students will understand the mechanism by which they can programatically authenticate securely to all
three apps.

10 min break


Hour 2~3 - Advanced JSON Analysis - Module 2 10:15am-12pm GMT
==========================================

15 min - Instructor will run an api call to Thousand Eyes and retrieve the json response from the API and then demonstrate
a variety of methods to work with the JSON output from this API using the bulk provisioning of tests as an example.

15 min - Students will run the lab task for thousand eyes and import the auth module we covered in Module 1 - save the JSON output
to their branch, then repeating the steps the instructor demonstrated, use jupyter notebook to complete the 'Module 2 Challenge'
Results will be committed to their branch and will be evaluated and results delivered. Students who are not able to complete the challenge with in 
15 minutes may submit after the day is done.

15 min - Instructor will run api calls to App Dynamics and use jupyter notebook to illustrate a variety of techniques for analyzing
the json response
15 min - Students will make an api call of their choice and use jupyter notebook to submit their work into their branch for eval.

15 min - Instructor will run api calls to Intersight and use jupyter notebook to illustrate a variety of techniques for analyzing
the json response
15 min - Students will make an api call of their choice and use jupyter notebook to submit their work into their branch for eval.

At the end of this module, students will understand advanced tequniques for manipulating json responses from all three apis 

30 min lunch break.

Hour 3 - AppD Use Cases -Module 3 - 12:30 pm GMT-1 pm GMT
==========================================================

15 min Instructor will cover major use cases for App D via powerpoint and high level concepts
15 min Instructor will demonstrate API calls that pertain to the main use cases
15 min Students will tackle the Module 3 challenge which will be explained by Instructor - Help wil be available in the chat
Students are to commit their work to their git branch for evaluation
Winner of Challenge will be announced.

At the end of this module, Students will understand the App D main uses cases and how to perform API calls accordingly.

Hour 4 -  Module 4 - AppD and Thousand Eyes Integrations 1 pm~1:45 pm GMT followed by 15 min break
===================================================================================================
15 min Instructor will go over the integrations between Thousand Eyes and App D via Power Point (high level concepts)
15 min Instructor will make API calls and show students how to perform the lab tasks for integration via API
15 Students will engage in the lab task for the integration via API calls.

Module 5 - Intersight 2 pm ~ 3 pm GMT
======================
15 min - Instructor will use Power Point to provide an high level overview of Intersight and the API
15 min - Instructor will demonstrate API techniques for Intersight
15 min - Students will complete the intersight API lab tasks

At the end of this module, Students will understand how to use the API to bulk administer objects using Intersight

Review 30 min
=================

Instructor will review all concepts covered in the day training and will answer as many questions as possible in the chat 
channel.

30 min - Instructor will cover the underlying lab architecture components 
15 min Power Point - Diagrams and high level concepts
15 min - Pipeline Demo - Deployment of entire underlying lab infrastructure automated.

This concludes Day 1.

Instructor will review and evaluate all the students committed code into their branches
