Challenge 1:

This Challenge will test your comprehension of:

Devops Workflow
Working with JSON output from the Thousand Eyes API

Refer to the Thousand Eyes API Documentation here:
https://developer.thousandeyes.com/v6

Pick any API you desire and write the python to return back the desired value or key value pair from the json response

For example, 

The following task has already been created:
te_api_task_challenge.yml

It already has the container referenced and the shell script: te_api_challenge.sh

Open and look at the file: te_api_challenge.sh

The shell script is calling the te_api_challenge-YOURNAME.py

rename this file to include your name and update the filename in the shell script

Update the URL in the python script with the desired URL

Run the task to see the json returned by the API.

Now add a comment to python to describe what key value pair you will get from this json

Write the python to return only the desired value, values, or key value pair from the JSON

Challenge 2 - Advanced

See if you can write a test via API that will test the metrics of an agent or multiple agents

hint:
get a list of tests

pick one or more tests and return the:
end-to-end_metrics

Please commit your work to your branch for review.
