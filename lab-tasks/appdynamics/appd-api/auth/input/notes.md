Please complete the App D Challenge - This should take about 5 min....

Please select any API call from the AppD API Documenation and Run it in your automation task.

From this point on, we will just be using the automation tasks to build our code and make our API calls.
It is much fast, more secure than manually running calls via Jupyter Notebook.

Also, we do not need to really "negotiate the api payload data ~ since the format is much more simple than Thousand Eyes"......
