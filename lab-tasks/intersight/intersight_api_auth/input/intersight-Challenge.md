Select a relevant - API based from the target type we have added into the Intersight:

UCS
AWS - X
Supercar-Trader App /Integration with AppDynamics

Run a new API call 
If your cozy with the python - update script and run your your task to build it.

If not cozy with code to task direct,  you can...
Out the Json to a file ...
Open it up or paste into Jupyter Notebook

Negotiate your json blob - to extract the relevant Moid

Why???????

We know that any Intersight POST API commands require a specific Moid in order for us to pass that input
into a POST command.
